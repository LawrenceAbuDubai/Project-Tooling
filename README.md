# Project-Tooling

## intro :

this is a small introduction to the project tooling page , in this page i will talk about afew software development tools that i choose to use.
first of all the IDEs , i choose two IDE which are Pycharm and visual studio code. 


## stage 1 : 2.1 : IDE

first of all the IDEs , i choose two IDE which are Pycharm and visual studio code : 

### pycharm : 

#### what is pycharm : 

PyCharm is a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that includes a variety of key tools for Python developers that are tightly integrated to create a pleasant environment for effective Python, web, and data science development.

#### advantages of pycharm : 

+ Intelligent Coding Assistance : PyCharm has smart code completion, code inspections, on-the-fly error flagging and quick fixes, as well as automated code refactorings and rich navigation.

+ Built-in Developer Tools : An integrated debugger and test runner; Python profiler; a built-in terminal; integration with major VCS and built-in database tools; remote development capabilities with remote interpreters; an integrated ssh terminal; and integration with Docker and Vagrant are just a few of PyCharm's many features.

+ Web Development : PyCharm supports a number of Python web development frameworks, as well as JavaScript, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, AngularJS, Node.js, and other languages.

+ Scientific Tools : PyCharm is compatible with IPython Notebook, features an interactive Python terminal, and supports Anaconda as well as a number of scientific packages such as Matplotlib and NumPy.

+ Customizable and Cross-platform IDE : With a single license key, you may use PyCharm on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Customize your workplace with adjustable color schemes and keybindings, as well as VIM emulation.


### Visual Studio Code :

#### what is Visual Studio Code : 

Visual Studio Code is a small yet capable source code editor that runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It contains built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, as well as a large ecosystem of extensions for additional languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, and Go) (such as .NET and Unity).

#### Visual Studio Code advantages : 

+ Accurate Coding : Users may get live coding assistance using Visual Studio IDE, regardless of the programming language they're using. IntelliSense, which is embedded into the platform, provides API tips and explanations, as well as auto-completes lines for faster typing.
Additionally, the Visual Studio IDE guarantees that developers do not lose track of where they were when they last modified their code.

+ Quick Debugging : Finding and diagnosing problems may be difficult, but the Visual Studio IDE provides a number of tools to help. All of the languages supported in the platform include debugging capability. The procedure can be carried out on-site, remotely, or in the middle of a manufacturing run. This allows developers to test programs on the desktop or in mobile device emulators, as well as use other debugging methods.

+ Rigorous Testing : The Visual Studio IDE includes an app testing platform that allows developers to ensure that their apps are suitable for deployment. They can accomplish this with minimal effort in their favorite language and testing framework. They will be able to focus more of their energy on other stages of growth as a result of this.

+ Team Collaboration : Visual Studio IDE's creators recognize that multiple eyes are better than one. As a result, the platform includes collaboration features that boost a team's efficiency. The development lifecycle is tightly integrated with these tools. Furthermore, regardless of each member's preferred platform, Visual Studio IDE operates effectively in collaborative mode.

+ Customization Options : Every user of the Visual Studio IDE has the ability to customize it. They may enhance the platform's capabilities by using extensions and add-ons from the Visual Studio Marketplace. Developers can even create and distribute their own extensions.


## stage 1 : 2.1 : Operating System

for the Operating Systems i choose , i choose two as well , which are linux and windows : 

### linux 

#### what is linux : 

Linux is a kind of computer operating system. In reality, the Linux operating system powers one of the most popular platforms on the world, Android. An operating system is a piece of software that controls all of the hardware resources on your computer or laptop. Simply defined, the operating system is in charge of coordinating the connection between your program and your hardware. The software would not work without the operating system (OS).

#### linux advantages : 

+ open Source : Its source code is freely accessible because it is open-source. The operating system may be customized by anybody with programming skills. The code can be contributed to, modified, distributed, and improved for any purpose.

+ Security : The major reason that Linux is the best option for developers is because of its security features. It isn't totally safe, but it is safer than other options. Each application needs to authorize by the admin user. Until the administrator delivers the access password, the virus is not executed. Antivirus software is not required on Linux computers.

+ Free :Obviously, the most significant benefit of the Linux operating system is that it is free to use. We may easily download it and do not need to purchase a license. It is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) (General Public License). In comparison, the licensing for the other operating systems costs a lot of money.

+ Lightweight : Linux is a light operating system. Linux has much less needs than other operating systems. Linux has a smaller memory footprint and uses less storage space. In general, most Linux distributions only required 128MB of RAM and around the same amount of disk space.

+ Stability : Linux has a higher level of stability than other operating systems. To sustain performance levels, Linux does not require a reboot. It almost never hangs up or slows down. It has a long uptime.

+ Performance : The Linux operating system delivers excellent performance over a variety of networks. It has the ability to handle a big number of users at the same time.

+ Flexibility : The Linux operating system is extremely adaptable. Desktop applications, embedded devices, and server applications can all benefit from it. It also offers a number of computer-specific limitation settings. Only the system's essential components can be installed.



### windows 

#### what is windows OS : 
Microsoft Windows, or just Windows, is a collection of proprietary graphical operating system families that are all created and marketed by Microsoft. Each family focuses on a different aspect of the computing industry. Windows NT and Windows IoT are active Microsoft Windows families; these may contain subfamilies (e.g. Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact) (Windows CE). Windows 9x, Windows Mobile, and Windows Phone are all defunct Microsoft Windows family.

#### windows advantages : 

+ The ease with which it can be used :  Users who are familiar with older versions of Windows will likely find the most recent versions to be simple to use as well. Everything from the uniform look and feel of nearly all Windows programs to the way the file system has been displayed since the days of MS-DOS may be attributed to this (disk A:\, disk C:\, etc.). One of the primary reasons why Windows users are hesitant to switch operating systems is because of this.

+ New hardware is supported. Virtually all hardware makers will give compatibility for a current version of Windows when they go to market with a new device. Microsoft's software industry dominance makes it impossible for hardware makers to ignore Windows. So, if you go to a store today and buy some random new computer hardware, it will almost certainly work with the most recent version of Windows.

+ Compatibility with MS driven websites : Soon after Microsoft began integrating Internet Explorer (IE) with Windows 95 in order to crush competition from competitor Netscape's Navigator browser, Internet Explorer (IE) became the world's most used web browser. Since the fall of Netscape, Microsoft has added an increasing number of proprietary capabilities to their web servers that can only be used with Internet Explorer. These sites are obviously less accessible in other browsers, and in some cases not at all. This, along with the fact that the most recent versions of Internet Explorer are only available for Windows, has made Windows the only option for people who wish to fully utilize those Â websites that use Microsoft's technology.



## stage 1 : 2.1 : Version-control platform

for the Version-control platforms i choose , i choose two as well , github and gitlab : 

### github 

#### what is github : 

GitHub is a for-profit firm that provides Git repository hosting in the cloud. It essentially makes using Git for version control and collaboration more easier for individuals and organizations.

The GitHub interface is simple enough that even inexperienced programmers can use it. Without GitHub, utilizing Git usually necessitates a little more technical know-how and command-line experience.

However, because GitHub is so user-friendly, some people use it to handle other sorts of projects as well.

#### github advantages : 

1. It makes contributing to open source projects simple : To be honest, GitHub is used to handle almost every open-source project. If your project is open source, GitHub is free to use, and it contains a wiki and issue tracker that make it simple to provide more detailed documentation and get feedback. To contribute, just clone a project, make your changes, and submit a pull request through the GitHub web interface.

2. Accurate documentation : You make it easy to acquire good documentation by utilizing GitHub. They offer articles on virtually every issue connected to git that you can think of in their help section and tutorials.

3. Display your efforts : Do you want to attract recruiters as a developer? The greatest tool you can use for this is GitHub. Most organizations now check at GitHub profiles while looking for fresh personnel for their projects. Even if you did not attend a prestigious university or college, if your profile is available, you will have a better chance of being hired.

4. markdown : Markdown allows you to produce styled texts using a simple text editor. Everything on GitHub is written in Markdown, including the issue tracker, user comments, and everything else. With so many other computer languages to master in order to build up projects, having your content submitted in a format without having to learn yet another system is a huge benefit.

5. GitHub is a file-sharing platform : This has previously been said, but it's worth repeating: GitHub is a repository.
This implies that it is possible for your work to be seen by the general audience. Furthermore, GitHub is one of the largest coding communities in the world right now, giving your project a lot of exposure.


### gitlab 

#### what is gitlab : 
GitLab is an open-source web-based DevOps lifecycle solution that includes a Git repository manager, a wiki, issue tracking, and a continuous integration and deployment pipeline.

#### gitlab advantages : 

+ Convenient setup : In CI/CD technologies, server configuration might be time-consuming. With certain solutions, the IT department will be unable to deploy the tool in a cloud provider or on-premises unless the company pays a significant fee.

+ Source code security: A CI/CD pipeline's security and compliance are critical concerns. Controlling where code resides and who has access to it should be part of security.

+ Pipeline automation: GitLab provides an Auto DevOps tool that uses the CI/CD pipeline to detect, create, test, deploy, and monitor apps. Everything that developers desire or are already doing with automation is covered by the capability. Because teams don't undertake manual setup for those stages, Auto DevOps saves time and promotes best practices. For all projects, GitLab automatically turns on the functionality.



## stage 1 : 2.2 : 

in this part , i will talk about which IDE, OS and Version-control platform i choose to develop my application.

lets start with IDE : 

### IDE :
to choose one of the IDEs i have, i went to look for 3 sides : 

1. Performance
in terms of performance i choose **Visual Studio Code** because it consumes less memory compared to pycharm , and that is because it does not run as a full IDE like pycharm and mostly like a text editor. 
 

2. Extensibility 
i choose **Visual Studio Code** again here because : 
PyCharm is part of the JetBrains IDE family, and all of the JetBrains IDEs allow for plugin extension. On the JetBrains website, PyCharm now offers almost 3000 extensions.

VS Code, on the other hand, is intended to be a basic editor that can be expanded into a full IDE with the help of extensions. A single addon provides complete Python functionality (including syntax highlighting, debugging, and code completion). VS Code offers extensions for nearly everything, and developers may easily create their own. The VS Code Marketplace has all of these extensions. As a result, VS Code is considerably more expandable than PyCharm.


3. Ease of use
i choose **Visual Studio Code** again here because : 
PyCharm includes a lot of capabilities that most people don't use on a daily basis (advanced code restructuring tools), and finding out where to locate the configuration settings if you've never used it before may be a little difficult.

It's a lot easier to figure out how to configure VS Code. Simply press Ctrl+Shift+P to bring up a command palette where you may search for whatever you want to perform, and it will appear in the results.

results : 

PyCharm is a fantastic tool with a slew of features that make Python programming a breeze. However, virtually all of the capabilities I use are available in VS Code, with the exception of remote debugging, which is now in development in VS Code.

That implies VS Code has virtually all of PyCharm's features, but at a far better performance and (of course) pricing.

thats why i choose **Visual Studio Code** as the IDE to use for my application.

### OS :

for the **OS** i choose linux because : 
The Linux operating system allows programmers and developers to freely modify, use, share, and publish their work. On Linux, there is a large database of programming languages to choose from. Different text editors, such as Vim, Atom, and VS Code, are available to end users. Linux also comes with a wealth of free software. Programmers and developers also benefit from being part of a huge community that helps to patch issues, making releases more dependable and secure than OSes like Windows. These are some of the benefits of Linux over Windows for programmers and developers.

also in comparing : 

+ Linux is a safe and secure operating system. Security threats are reduced as a result of regular bug fixes by programmers and developers.

+ End-users can choose from a variety of Linux distributions (flavors). Linux may be customized and optimized to meet the demands of the user. The scalability of Linux helps users to enhance their productivity.

+ Linux is a free and open-source operating system. Developers and programmers may save money on software and licensing.

+ Users may run Windows apps on Linux using open-source technologies like Wine. Wine is mostly used by gamers, however the Wine database also contains a huge variety of productivity apps.

+ Linux users have complete control over their upgrades. Update interruptions and restarting do not have to irritate them. In comparison to Windows, installation takes less time.

+ Linux is far more fluid and quicker than Windows. Users get extra free space on their hard drive and RAM when they utilize Linux. Less reliance on central processing (CPU).

+ The Linux community is large, and there are many training courses available, such as Cybrary's Fundamental Linux Administration course.



### Version-control platform

for version control platform i choose Github because how many advanages it has compared to gitlab , also Because of its vast community and user-configurable structure, GitHub availability is more and more frequent among developers.
